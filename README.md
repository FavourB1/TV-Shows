# TV Shows Finder

## Overview

**TV Shows Finder** is a web-based tool that allows users to discover and rate TV shows across various genres. It uses a JSON file containing data on 100 popular TV shows. The tool presents TV shows one by one, allowing users to rate them from 1 to 5, skip ones they're not interested in, or select "Haven't watched." After rating, the app provides recommendations based on the user's genre preferences.

## Features

- **Randomized TV Show Selection**: Displays 10 randomly selected TV shows at a time for rating, ensuring that previously rated shows are not repeated.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Uses user ratings to determine the top three preferred genres and recommends TV shows in those genres.
- **Interactive Rating System**: Users can rate each show from 1 to 5 or skip it, with ratings dynamically influencing genre preferences.
- **Visualized Genre Preferences**: After rating, a bar or pie chart displays the user's top genre preferences.
- **Option to Refine Recommendations**: Users can choose to rate additional TV shows to refine their recommendations further.
